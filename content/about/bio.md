# About me

Hi there! I'm Ralph -- currently a junior undergrad. I study physics at Ateneo de Manila University. I was born and raised in Manila, and am currently wandering around the streets of its busy metro area.

Aside from physics, I enjoy amateur photography, indie pop music, casual writing, and learning about penguins.
